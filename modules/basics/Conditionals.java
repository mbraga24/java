            Repeat the same exercise as above, but this time ensure that you are creating a new

            ==============
            Exercise 3
            ==============
            create an string variable using the `new` keyword
            create a second string variable which has the same value as the first, again using the
                `new` keyword
            create an `if` statement which compares the two variables and prints to the console if
                they are equal

            => How strange. We have two variables that are being assigned the same String value
                but they aren't equal? Why is this?

            => Try changing your answer to instead use the .equals() method. Does this change how
                your code behaves at all?

                Explanation ::
                We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method
                for content comparison. In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory
                location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

            In this example, we're going to try something a tad more involved. Let's make an
            if statement which checks if a String starts with a specified character. In this example,
            try using the .charAt() method which can be applied to strings within your if statement.
            Bear in mind that this method will yield a Character-type value, which will need to be
            compared against another Character within the condition. To create an inline variable of
            Character type, try using single quotes ' instead of double quotes ".

            previous answer. The idea is to use a for loop to check if the provided character is
            present at any point within our word.

            modify your `if` statement to check the character at each index
